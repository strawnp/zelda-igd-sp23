### GRADING

To assess this assignment, I will download all the code and run it. Everyone will get the same grade. First, resolve the 3 current issues. Once that is complete, pick a new issue to implement from the list above. When doing this, please create a new Issue for the feature, so we can track it and who is working on it. I would like a total of *three* additional features. Work together on everything; it does not have to be one issue/student.
